    <h1>Pancakes</h1>
    <p>A pancake is a flat, round cake made from a starch-based batter, typically containing flour, eggs, and milk. It
        is cooked on a hot surface like a griddle or frying pan and is often served for breakfast with toppings such as
        maple syrup and butter, or with savory fillings. Pancakes can vary in thickness depending on the recipe and are
        known globally by many different names</p>
